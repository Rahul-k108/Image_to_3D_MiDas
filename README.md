# Image_to_3D_MiDas

🖼️➡️🔲 Image to 3D Model Generator
This Jupyter Notebook lets you upload an image, estimates its depth using the MiDaS model, and then turns it into a 3D mesh you can download as .obj and .stl files. You’ll also see a preview of your 3D model.

📦 Requirements
Before running the notebook, make sure you have these Python libraries:

torch ,torchvision, timm, open3d, matplotlib, tqdm, pillow, ipywidgets, numpy


🛠️How It Works

Load MiDaS Model: Loads the MiDaS model to estimate depth from the image.

Depth Estimation: The depth map is created from the image.

Point Cloud and Mesh: Converts the depth map into a 3D point cloud, then creates a mesh using Open3D.

Save 3D Model: The mesh is saved as .obj and .stl files.


💡 Notes & Tips

If you get an error about the MiDaS model being loaded, restart the kernel and try again.

The 3D preview uses Open3D’s viewer. If it doesn’t open, check your Jupyter setup or try running locally.

The mesh is a rough 3D shape based on depth estimation-it won’t be perfect, but it’s fun for experimenting!

Works best with clear, simple images (portraits, objects, etc.).
